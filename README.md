Helium Game Engine
==================

Helium is a lightweight game engine built on the idea of having a very simple engine that handles everything using a multithreaded approach.

## Core Principles

* Who needs a crazy powerful engine for their game? Helium is meant to be just the bare necessities so games made with it
as performant as possible and can run on basically any hardware that supports it.

* Multithreaded approach. Helium separates the game logic apart from the rendering. The goal here is to avoid any frame drops due to heavy
computation on the logical portion of the game.

## Features

- [x] Rendering
- [x] Entity Component System
- [ ] Collisions (WIP)
- [ ] Physics (WIP)

### Planned Features:

* Audio
* Gui support
* Compute Shaders
